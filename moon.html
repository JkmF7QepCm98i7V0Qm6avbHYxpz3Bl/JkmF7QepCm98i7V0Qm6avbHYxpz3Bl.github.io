        <p>The Moon is the only natural satellite revolving around the <a href="/solarsystem.html#earth">Earth</a>. The
          Moon
          is the only place besides Earth where humans have set foot. The rotation between the Moon and the Earth are so
          in
          sync that we only see one side of the Moon. Only 24 humans have travelled from the Earth to the Moon and of
          those
          24, only 12 have walked on the surface. Man first visited the Moon in 1969 and the last time a person set foot
          on
          the lunar surface was in 1972.</p>

        <p>The most widely accepted explanation for the existence of the Moon is that it was created when a rock the
          size of
          Mars ran into the Earth. A full moon occurs when the Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun
          and
          the Sun illuminates the it's face fully. Usually lunar craters are either named for deceased scientists,
          scholars,
          explores and artists OR for deceased astronauts/cosmonauts. </p>
