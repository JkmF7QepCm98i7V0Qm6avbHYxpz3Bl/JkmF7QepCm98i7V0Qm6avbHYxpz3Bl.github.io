          <b>Stress Testing Super Hornet’s Wings</b>
          <br />
          <br /> Teams at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, recently completed stress
          testing on the Navy’s F/A-18E Super Hornet aircraft from the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) in Patuxent
          River, Maryland. The Super Hornet is seen here in a top view from March 2022 while in a wing loading test
          configuration at Armstrong.
          <br />
          <br /> Understanding what stress, or strain, an aircraft can endure is critical to carrying out its intended
          mission. To better understand the aircraft’s capacity for strain, unique facilities can “load” the aircraft to
          specified stress points and document its performance. The test data resulted in the development of loads
          equations that calculate real-time loads experienced during flight testing, which can be compared to
          established design limits to ensure safety of flight and crew.

          <b>NASA T-38s Soar Over Artemis I</b>
          <br />
          <br /> T-38 planes are a fixture of astronaut training, assisting pilots and mission specialists to think
          quickly in changing situations. Here, our T-38s fly in formation above the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on
          Launch Pad 39B. The SLS and Orion spacecraft for the Artemis I mission will launch no earlier than Aug. 29,
          2022.
          <br />
          <br /> Astronaut Andrew Morgan posted this and two other photos on Twitter on Aug. 25, 2022, saying “This week
          we flew over @NASAArtemis, thanking the @nasa centers across the country that put this Moon rocket on
          @NASAKennedy’s pad and celebrating the upcoming test flight!”

          <b>SGreetings from the Cupola</b>
          <br />
          <br /> Expedition 67 flight engineers Bob Hines and Jessica Watkins are all smiles in this Sept. 12, 2022,
          image from the International Space Station cupola. The cupola is used to monitor the arrival of spaceships and
          to view the Earth.
          <br />
          <br /> Hines, Watkins, Kjell Lindgren, and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will begin
          the return journey to Earth on Oct. 12, 2022, with splashdown targeted for 5:41 p.m. EDT Thursday, Oct. 13.
          This will mark the end of a nearly six-month science mission in which members of Crew-4 conducted new and
          exciting scientific research in areas such as materials science, health technologies, and plant science to
          prepare for human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and benefit life on Earth.
